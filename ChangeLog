Changes in 0.2.8-3 - January 2004
=================================
	* Bugs:
	- Color saturation was being factored in _way_ too much for playlist
	  generation (thanks to William Thomas for pointing this out)
	- Fix case where some long analysis runs were not getting written to 
	  data.xml properly (sourceforge bug 698761)
	* Features:
	- Make playlist time 4 digits wide so users can have extra-long
	  list (sourceforge bug 745364)
	- Use both inode and dev for identifying symlinks (debian bug 227122)

Changes in 0.2.8-2 - December 2003
==================================
	* Patch: 
	- Apply Udi Meiri's patch to escape not_song paths.

Changes in 0.2.8 - December 2003
=============================
	* Bugs:
	- Some (evil) ID3 tags were not readable and caused a core dump. 
	  (Debian bug 222195)
	* UI:
	- Support full HSV model for song color selection.

Changes in 0.2.7 - November 2003
================================
	*  Bugs:
	- (Provided by Giacomo Catenazzi) verify opendir()
	* Architecture:
	- Removed dependancy on mp3info to read ID3 tags. This gives a significant
	  speedup. 
	- Along the way, allow us to read styles not supported by mp3info, notably
	  iTunes-ripped mp3s
	- Ogg vorbis is now optional (though highly desired, of course)
	* UI:
	- Added menubar, moved prefs and about into there
	- Improved directory selection dialog
	- Jump to song currently playing in XMMS 

Changes in 0.2.6 - January 19, 2003
===================================
	* Features:
	- Display highlight icon next to directories containing new songs (those
	  which haven't been had rank or color set)
	* Bugs: 
	- Empty directories do not cause crashes when clicked upon (doh!)
	- Avoid localization alltogether w/r/t reading data ("." vs "," decimal)
	  by writing local strtof function which is decimal locale agnostic
	- Found recursive directory scan bug 
	- Fixed very serious bug in which new repeat songs would not be shown

Changes in 0.2.5 - January 07, 2003
===================================
	* Features:
	- Tweaked UI: removed "select directory contents non-recursively" option
	  for the sake of simplicity. All selection is recursive.
	- Command-line playlists accept filename starting points (-f option)
	* Bugs:
	- Did not properly escape all the fields in the XML data file
	- While I wasn't able to fix a certain class of rare hard-to-diagnose
	  cases having to do with file selection in wacky trees, it now fails
	  gracefully instead of catastrophically.
	- If a filename has gone bad, remove the file from the GJay data file
	  and don't use it for playlist generation. 

Changes in 0.2.4 - December 15, 2002
====================================
	* Features:
	- Playlists can be generated from the command-line
	- Command line options are more forgiving
	- Added manpage installation to install process
	* Bugs:
	- More problems with internationalized decimal format
	- Playlists didn't pick up latin1/UTF-8 changes
	- Should build on IA64
	
0.2.3 - December 3, 2002
========================
	- Song data, prefs stored in XML
	- Periodically write song data to disk, if it has changed
	- Display friendly feedback as songs are added to GJay
	- Check for duplicate songs such that analysis won't be repeated. Repeat
	  songs show up in the file view, but only one repeat will be chosen in a 
	  playlist.
	- Assume Latin1 encoding for song names such that we can convert them to 
	  UTF8 for user-visible display (prevents Pango from freaking out)
	- Nice the analysis daemon to 19
	* Bugs: 
	 - Analysis updates weren't showing up for the selected song
	 
0.2.2 - November 24, 2002
=========================
	* Minor fixes:
	- Fixed compiler warnings
	- Locale could affect whether prefs and song data files write decimal
	  numbers using a comma or period, which could lead to a seg fault. Now
	  we always use a period. (Erich Schubert)
	- Analysis would hang on extremely short files (Erich Schubert)

0.2 - November 19, 2002
=======================
	* Complete overhaul (Chuck Groom) :
	- Switched from Gtk-1.2 to Gtk-2.0
	- UI: The main screen is an "explorer" folder view. The user sets a root
	  music directory, GJay takes it from there.
	- Daemon: GJay analysis runs in a separate process which can be separated
	  from the UI for background processing.
	- Format: All file formats have changed. Files are now human-readable. 
	  There are now separate files for song attributes and song data (ie.
	  stuff that changes and stuff that doesn't changes). Files are
	  generally appended, not overwritten. When a file needs to be overwritten,
	  we write to a temporary file and rename. 

0.1.4.1 - October 15, 2002 
==========================
	- Ogg attributes are discovered w/o case sensitivity (Sean Perry,
	  Joshua Judson Rosen)
	- Messages are displayed in single window containing scrolling text display,
	  not a (potential) multitude of cascading windows (Joshua Judson Rosen)

0.1.4 - September 21, 2002 (Chuck Groom)
========================================
	- Analysis is much faster. Single decode and faster BPM and spectrum analysis.
	- In frequency pass, also record difference between max frame
	  vol. and average frame volume. This information is used to nudge
	  frequency matches to improve song matching.
	- We now save periodically (every 5 min)
	- The next song's randomness is now decided from a gaussian instead of 
	  strictly linear random distribution. 
	

0.1.3 - September 9, 2002
=========================
	- Solve frequency endian issues; won't crash PPC (Devin Carraway)
	- Change to log freq scale, redo freq. matching and dist. algorithms. 
	  If you load an older version data file, freq. data will be
		re-calculated. (Chuck Groom)
	- Minor fix -- once freq. is calculated, redraw song s.t. you don't have
	  to wait for BPM to see the pretty frequency drawing.
	- Sprintf file names surrounded by single quote, after single quote chars 
	  (Andrew Baumann)
	- Increase fixed len buffer size to max POSIX filename len, to avoid any
	  nastiness there

0.1.2 - September 4, 2002
=========================

	- Make GJay threadsafe (Devin Carraway)
	- Song delete is threadsafe w/r/t analysis (CG)
	- Makefile improvements (DC and Andrew Baumann)
	- Song delete actually frees memory (CG)
	- File names can now contain spaces and quotes (CG and Andrew Baumann)
	- Adds some system includes (AB)
	- The ~/.gjay directory is created with user read permissions (AB)
	- Fixed segfault by initializing pointer to null (AB)
	- Fixed song delete behavior (AB and CG)

	
0.1.1 - September 3, 2002
=========================
	-Fixed creation of ~/.gjay directory

0.1 - September 2, 2002
=======================
	- Initial release
