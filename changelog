0.1.4.1 - October 15, 2002 
- Ogg attributes are discovered w/o case sensitivity (Sean Perry,
  Joshua Judson Rosen)
- Messages are displayed in single window containing scrolling text display,
  not a (potential) multitude of cascading windows (Joshua Judson Rosen)

0.1.4 - September 21, 2002 (Chuck Groom)
- Analysis is much faster. Single decode and faster BPM and spectrum analysis.
- In frequency pass, also record difference between max frame
  vol. and average frame volume. This information is used to nudge
  frequency matches to improve song matching.
- We now save periodically (every 5 min)
- The next song's randomness is now decided from a gaussian instead of 
  strictly linear random distribution. 
	

0.1.3 - September 9, 2002
- Solve frequency endian issues; won't crash PPC (Devin Carraway)
- Change to log freq scale, redo freq. matching and dist. algorithms. 
  If you load an older version data file, freq. data will be re-calculated.
  (Chuck Groom)
- Minor fix -- once freq. is calculated, redraw song s.t. you don't have
  to wait for BPM to see the pretty frequency drawing.
- Sprintf file names surrounded by single quote, after single quote chars 
  (Andrew Baumann)
- Increase fixed len buffer size to max POSIX filename len, to avoid any
  nastiness there


0.1.2 - September 4, 2002

- Make GJay threadsafe (Devin Carraway)
- Song delete is threadsafe w/r/t analysis (CG)
- Makefile improvements (DC and Andrew Baumann)
- Song delete actually frees memory (CG)
- File names can now contain spaces and quotes (CG and Andrew Baumann)
- Adds some system includes (AB)
- The ~/.gjay directory is created with user read permissions (AB)
- Fixed segfault by initializing pointer to null (AB)
- Fixed song delete behavior (AB and CG)
