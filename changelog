0.3.0 - June, 2003
- Architecture:
   - Removed dependancy on mp3info to read ID3 tags. This gives a significant
     speedup.
	
0.2.6 - January 19, 2003
- Features:
   - Display highlight icon next to directories containing new songs (those
     which haven't been had rank or color set)
- Bugs: 
   - Empty directories do not cause crashes when clicked upon (doh!)
   - Avoid localization alltogether w/r/t reading data ("." vs "," decimal)
     by writing local strtof function which is decimal locale agnostic
   - Found recursive directory scan bug 
   - Fixed very serious bug in which new repeat songs would not be shown

0.2.5 - January 07, 2003
- Features:
   - Tweaked UI: removed "select directory contents non-recursively" option
     for the sake of simplicity. All selection is recursive.
   - Command-line playlists accept filename starting points (-f option)
- Bugs:
   - Did not properly escape all the fields in the XML data file
   - While I wasn't able to fix a certain class of rare hard-to-diagnose
     cases having to do with file selection in wacky trees, it now fails
     gracefully instead of catastrophically.
   - If a filename has gone bad, remove the file from the GJay data file
     and don't use it for playlist generation. 

0.2.4 - December 15, 2002
- Features:
   - Playlists can be generated from the command-line
   - Command line options are more forgiving
   - Added manpage installation to install process
- Bugs:
   - More problems with internationalized decimal format
   - Playlists didn't pick up latin1/UTF-8 changes
   - Should build on IA64
	
0.2.3 - December 3, 2002
- Song data, prefs stored in XML
- Periodically write song data to disk, if it has changed
- Display friendly feedback as songs are added to GJay
- Check for duplicate songs such that analysis won't be repeated. Repeat
  songs show up in the file view, but only one repeat will be chosen in a 
  playlist.
- Assume Latin1 encoding for song names such that we can convert them to 
  UTF8 for user-visible display (prevents Pango from freaking out)
- Nice the analysis daemon to 19
- Bugs: 
    - Analysis updates weren't showing up for the selected song
    
0.2.2 - November 24, 2002
- Minor fixes
   - Fixed compiler warnings
   - Locale could affect whether prefs and song data files write decimal
     numbers using a comma or period, which could lead to a seg fault. Now
     we always use a period. (Erich Schubert)
   - Analysis would hang on extremely short files (Erich Schubert)

0.2 - November 19, 2002
- Complete overhaul (Chuck Groom) 
   - Switched from Gtk-1.2 to Gtk-2.0
   - UI: The main screen is an "explorer" folder view. The user sets a root
     music directory, GJay takes it from there.
   - Daemon: GJay analysis runs in a separate process which can be separated
     from the UI for background processing.
   - Format: All file formats have changed. Files are now human-readable. 
     There are now separate files for song attributes and song data (ie.
     stuff that changes and stuff that doesn't changes). Files are
     generally appended, not overwritten. When a file needs to be overwritten,
     we write to a temporary file and rename. 

0.1.4.1 - October 15, 2002 
- Ogg attributes are discovered w/o case sensitivity (Sean Perry,
  Joshua Judson Rosen)
- Messages are displayed in single window containing scrolling text display,
  not a (potential) multitude of cascading windows (Joshua Judson Rosen)

0.1.4 - September 21, 2002 (Chuck Groom)
- Analysis is much faster. Single decode and faster BPM and spectrum analysis.
- In frequency pass, also record difference between max frame
  vol. and average frame volume. This information is used to nudge
  frequency matches to improve song matching.
- We now save periodically (every 5 min)
- The next song's randomness is now decided from a gaussian instead of 
  strictly linear random distribution. 
	

0.1.3 - September 9, 2002
- Solve frequency endian issues; won't crash PPC (Devin Carraway)
- Change to log freq scale, redo freq. matching and dist. algorithms. 
  If you load an older version data file, freq. data will be re-calculated.
  (Chuck Groom)
- Minor fix -- once freq. is calculated, redraw song s.t. you don't have
  to wait for BPM to see the pretty frequency drawing.
- Sprintf file names surrounded by single quote, after single quote chars 
  (Andrew Baumann)
- Increase fixed len buffer size to max POSIX filename len, to avoid any
  nastiness there


0.1.2 - September 4, 2002

- Make GJay threadsafe (Devin Carraway)
- Song delete is threadsafe w/r/t analysis (CG)
- Makefile improvements (DC and Andrew Baumann)
- Song delete actually frees memory (CG)
- File names can now contain spaces and quotes (CG and Andrew Baumann)
- Adds some system includes (AB)
- The ~/.gjay directory is created with user read permissions (AB)
- Fixed segfault by initializing pointer to null (AB)
- Fixed song delete behavior (AB and CG)

	
0.1.1 - September 3, 2002

-Fixed creation of ~/.gjay directory
