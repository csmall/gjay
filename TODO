This is a list of the features I know GJay needs, and am focusing on.
Input is always appreciated!

- Allow GJay to be run in command-line mode to:
   - Add and analyze files
   - Generate playlists

- The categorize dialog should include a list of color/label pairs to the
  right of the color wheel so users can jot down what colors
  (e.g. "dark red") mean to them
