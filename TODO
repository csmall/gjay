TODO list for GJay
==================
My main aim was to get GJay working on 64-bit architectures, like my amd64.
That aim is complete, but below are some other things I'd like to work on:

 - Support for other players other than audacious
 - If there are other players, then I'll make the audacious code have a
   soft dependency, just like the filetypes
 - Someone suggested the filename attribute be replaced by album and
   artist which makes more sense to me.

Below is a list of the features Chuck knew GJay needed, and was focusing on.
Input is always appreciated!

- Add freq. and BPM information to the comment portion of ogg files so 
  users sharing oggs won't need to analyze them again

- Expand range of GJay command-line options to support:
   - Add files to analysis queue 

- Color categorization should allow an optional mechanism for naming colors,
  e.g. "dark red means crunchy industrial beats"
