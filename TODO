This is a list of the features I know GJay needs, and am focusing on.
Input is always appreciated!

- Add freq. and BPM information to the comment portion of ogg files so 
  users sharing oggs won't need to analyze them again

- Expand range of GJay command-line options to support:
   - Add files to analysis queue 

- Color categorization should allow an optional mechanism for naming colors,
  e.g. "dark red means crunchy industrial beats"
