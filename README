GJay v0.1
(c) Chuck Groom, September 2002
gjay.sourceforge.net

GJay (Gtk+ DJ) generates playlists across a collection of music (mp3,
ogg, wav) such that each song sounds good following the previous
song. Matches are based on both automatically analyzed song
characteristics (BPM, frequency) as well as user-assigned
categorizations (song 'color' and rating). It is ideal for DJs
planning a set list or home users who want a non-random way to wander
large collections.

Help and random information can be found at http://gjay.sourceforge.net.

GJay is released under the GPL (see COPYING). 

BPM analysis code comes from Van Belle Werner's "bpmdj",

Frequency analysis code comes from Daniel Franklin's "Spectromatic",

BUILD
-----

GJay depends on the following programs:
  mp3info
  mpg321
  ogg123
  xmms

GJay depends on the following libraries:
  libgtk-1.2
  libgsl
  libgslcblas
  libvorbis
  libvorbisfile
  libxmms

To build GJay, you'll need libvorbis-dev and libgtk1.2-dev (assuming
Debian).  GJay does not yet install itself anywhere or use autoconf;
just "make."
