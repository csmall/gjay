GJay v0.2

gjay.sourceforge.net

GJay (Gtk+ DJ) generates playlists across a collection of music (mp3,
ogg, wav) such that each song sounds good following the previous
song. Matches are based on both automatically analyzed song
characteristics (BPM, frequency) as well as user-assigned
categorizations (song 'color' and rating). It is ideal for DJs
planning a set list or home users who want a non-random way to wander
large collections.

See http://gjay.sourceforge.net for help and more information.

GJay is released under the GPL (see COPYING). 

BPM analysis code comes from Van Belle Werner's "bpmdj",

Frequency analysis code comes from Daniel Franklin's "Spectromatic",
