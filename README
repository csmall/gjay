GJay (Gtk+ DJ) generates playlists across a collection of music (mp3,
ogg, wav) such that each song sounds good following the previous
song. Matches are based on both automatically analyzed song
characteristics (BPM, frequency) as well as user-assigned
categorizations (song 'color' and rating). It is ideal for DJs
planning a set list and home users wanting a non-random way to wander
large collections.

See http://gjay.sourceforge.net for help and more information.

GJay is released under the GPL (see COPYING). 

BPM analysis code comes from Van Belle Werner's "bpmdj",

Frequency analysis code comes from Daniel Franklin's "Spectromatic",

BUILD
-----

GJay uses the following programs:
  mpg321
  ogg123
  audacious

GJay depends on the following libraries:
  libgtk-2.0
  libgsl
  libgslcblas
  libaudacious

GJay supports ogg if it's there (a soft dependancy):
  libvorbis
  libvorbisfile
  
To build GJay, you'll need the header files for libgsl, audacious, and Gtk2
and libvorbis-dev

The relevant Debain packages are:
mpg321 vorbis-tools audacious
libgtk2.0 libgsl0 libvorbis (Debian keeps mucking about with this name...)
libgtk1.2-dev audacious-dev libgsl0-dev
